#Â Choreography

Motion is crucial to telling the story of a UI.

I wanted to solve the problem of View Transitions on the web.
And per Unix Philosophy, do only that and do it well.


The library should work with native HTML/CSS and use the new Web Animations API.


The intention is to create a lightweight API and work with plain HTML/CSS.
There are some small limitations to simplify things, e.g. what a 'View' is.
This will be explored through demos/examples first before defining,
but roughly the idea is that a View is a HTML element that acts as an
absolutely positioned container, which is fullscreen relative to its' parent.



## Dependencies

* Web Animations API
* HTMLElement.prototype.matches
* HTMLElement.prototype.closest
